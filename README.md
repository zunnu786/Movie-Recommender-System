# Movie-Recommender-System
This is a simple movie recommender system built using Streamlit, where users can select a movie from a dropdown menu and get recommendations for similar movies.
## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3
Streamlit
Pandas
## You can install Streamlit and Pandas using pip:
pip install streamlit pandas

## Running the Application
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
4. Open your web browser and go to localhost:8501 to view the application.

## How it Works
The recommender system uses a collaborative filtering approach to recommend similar movies. It computes the similarity between movies based on their features and recommends movies with high similarity scores.

## Files
1. Select a movie from the dropdown menu.
2. Click the "Recommend" button.
3. The system will display a list of recommended movies similar to the selected movie.
